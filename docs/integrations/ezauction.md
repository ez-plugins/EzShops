# EzAuction Integration

EzShops integrates with [EzAuction](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-21-%E2%AD%90-ezauction-%E2%AD%90-buy-orders-advanced-gui-show-shop-price.129779/) to display shop pricing information in auction menus.

## Features

When EzAuction is installed alongside EzShops, auction menus will show:
- Current shop buy prices for items
- Current shop sell prices for items
- Helpful context for players deciding on auction bids

## Setup

1. Install both [EzAuction](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-21-%E2%AD%90-ezauction-%E2%AD%90-buy-orders-advanced-gui-show-shop-price.129779/) and [EzShops](https://modrinth.com/plugin/ezshops) plugins
2. No additional configuration required
3. Integration activates automatically when both plugins are present

## How It Works

EzShops provides pricing data through its API that EzAuction can query. This allows auction interfaces to display relevant shop pricing alongside auction information, helping players make informed decisions about bidding or selling.

## Compatibility

- Requires EzAuction to be installed
- Fully optional - EzShops works normally without EzAuction
- No configuration needed
